## Using This Project as a Template

This project can be used as a template for creating new HTML websites. Here's how to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Project Structure**
   - `index.html` - Main landing page
   - `css/` - Contains all stylesheets
   - `js/` - JavaScript files and dependencies
   - `img/` - Image assets
   - `components/` - Reusable HTML components

3. **Documentation System**
   The project uses a comprehensive comment documentation system that can be maintained using the included Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 update_comments.py
   ```
   This script automatically:
   - Removes single-line comments
   - Adds structured block comments for major sections
   - Maintains consistent documentation across all HTML files

4. **Customization Steps**
   - Update the navigation menu in all HTML files
   - Replace content in each section
   - Modify the CSS in `css/app.css` for custom styling
   - Update images in the `img/` directory
   - Run the comment update script to maintain documentation

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep the Foundation 6 framework for responsive design
   - Maintain the comment structure for code readability
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements
   - Follow the established grid system for layout
   - Keep images optimized for web use
